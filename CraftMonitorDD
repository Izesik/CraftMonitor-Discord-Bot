sqlite Database:
-   stores guildId, channelId, messageId, and mcserverId
    -   guildId - holds the server ID (integer)
    -   channelId - holds the ID of the channel in which the bot operates
    -   messageId - holds the ID of the embed so the bought can return to and edit it based off of server
    -   mcserverId - holds the server ID that is inputed by the user

All columns, one row per server so the data can be retrieved and manipulated as needed


Commands:
1. configure - Allows user to configure the bot 
2. set_channel - Allows user to configure bot to a specific channel id within a guild 
3. server_status - Fetches data for server and displays in an embed
    -   Update the data in time intervals(X) and edit the embed to reflect the updates after this function is called
    -   will first check that the bot has been configured for the particular server 

TODO:
    - Add image support 
    - make delete messages after switching servers.
